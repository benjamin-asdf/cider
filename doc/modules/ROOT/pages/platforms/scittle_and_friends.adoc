= Scittle, Nbb, Joyride, and future plain repls

The default cider (clj-repl) should be capable of connecting to any
nrepl server that provides minimal functionality.

As such, all of these work:
https://github.com/babashka/nbb[nbb],
https://github.com/babashka/scittle[scittle], https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/joyride[joyride]

First start an nrepl server (the project's Readme usually has a section
on starting a nrepl server).

You can use

kbd:[M-x `cider-connect-clj` <RET>]

to connect to any plain Clojure(Script) nrepl server.

Features:

* Eval, load file etc.
* Errors as overlays. (The default cider error buffer is not implemented currently).
* Other nrepl features the server provides; This might be rather minimal.

Nbb, Scittle and Joyride all have quite cool completions already.

== Note

For nbb you can alternatively connect via cljs, see xref:platform/nbb.adoc[Nbb]
